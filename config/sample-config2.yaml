# With this sample config the distinction between LDAP-synchronized
# groups/users from manually created PostgreSQL users is done by the
# membership in ldap_user and ldap_group.
# These two roles have to be defined manally before pg_ldap_sync can
# run and all synchronized users/groups will become member of them
# later on:
#     CREATE GROUP ldap_groups;
#     CREATE USER ldap_users;
