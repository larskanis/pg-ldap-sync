=== 0.1.2 / 2016-10-18

* Add ability to have ldap groups and users with the same name merge into a single PG role
* Fixed to make dn's case insensitive as LDAP is case aware but not case sensitive
* Script will warn instead of die if role still owns objects in the database and can't be deleted from the database
* Script will warn about duplicate role. You should only run into this the first time you run this script against an existing server and you are using the "ldap_users" and "ldap_groups".
* Added testing for usage of "ldap_users" and "ldap_groups" group name
* Added "grant_this_group" to the pg_users and pg_groups YAML config file to support moving a user to become group to become user and to auto create these groups if they do not exist

=== 0.1.1 / 2012-11-15

=== 0.1.0 / 2011-07-13
